## Changelog

### 0.2.3 
No more of that weird prefix stuff, completions that you have never chosen will be deprioitized but not prefixed. 

### 0.2.0
Removed unnecessary files

### 0.1.0
In an attempt to prevent this extension from cluttering Intellisense:
- Import completions you have chosen before will now get an highly increased priority
- Import completions you have never chosen will be prefixed (configurable) to highly reduce their priority.

### 0.0.3
Released
